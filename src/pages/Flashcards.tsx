    question: "What is the law of conservation of energy?",
    answer: "Energy cannot be created or destroyed",
    explanation: "The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system; it can only be transformed from one form to another."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "What is Newton's second law of motion?",
    answer: "F = ma",
    explanation: "Newton's second law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. The formula is F = ma."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "What is the formula for calculating potential energy?",
    answer: "PE = mgh",
    explanation: "The gravitational potential energy is calculated as mass (m) times gravitational acceleration (g) times height (h)."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "What is Ohm's Law?",
    answer: "V = IR",
    explanation: "Ohm's Law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. The formula is V = IR, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "What is the formula for kinetic energy?",
    answer: "KE = 0.5mvÂ²",
    explanation: "Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, calculated as one-half times the mass of the object times the square of its velocity."
