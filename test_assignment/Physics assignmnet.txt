I'll create a simple physics assignment with 10 MCQs focused on basic mechanics and a corresponding user solution document.
Physics Assignment: Basic Mechanics
Instructions
This assignment tests your understanding of fundamental concepts in mechanics. Choose the best answer for each multiple-choice question. Each question is worth 10 points for a total of 100 points.
